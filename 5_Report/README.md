# Title of the project
##  ATM MACHINE

# Abstract
 Automated Teller Machine is belongs to embedded system, The main work of this machine is to provide banking services to customers so that it is included many facilities like balance enquiry, Cash withdraw and cash deposit. Customers can use the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to access their accounts without having to go to the bank. This ATM machine project is implemented using C programming language. Its having mainmenu option where all facilities are provided like when a user wants cash, they can input their PIN number (personal identification number), and the amount they want to withdraw will be presented in 100s,200s, 500s, and 2000s. The sum will be debited from their account once their withdrawal was completed along with the balance will be displayed.

# Block Diagram Explaination
Automated Teller Machine is provides banking services to customers so that it is included many facilities like balance enquiry, Cash withdraw and cash deposit.

# Result Explaination
Automated Teller Machine is implemented using C programming language because to prevent complication and kept things simple to the user. Its having options for cash withdraw, Balance enquiry and cash deposit when user pressed any of the options from mainmenu then that service gets provided to user by the ATM.
All high level and low level requirements are implemented. And all snapshots of each and every requirements are posted above.
